# Cybersecurity-UniPD
Cybersecurity course held in 2021/2022, 2022/2023 at UniPD by Prof. Conti and his assistants (only by them, ngl).
This repo, at least, really teaches the subjects.
It's a course that does everything in order to discard it (complete disinterest by anyone involved).
Here, concepts, challenges and exams are explained well and properly.

Material mostly from Fiup's MEGA, put up and reorganized for the most part in recent
years by yours truly, archived both for personal study (private repo made public)
and for future teaching (hence my file).

Given the many behind-the-scenes contributions I have made, it is kept public and in no way represents
a misappropriation of material, but a sharing of knowledge.
