# Cybersecurity-UniPD
Cybersecurity course held in 2021/2022, 2022/2023 at UniPD by Prof. Conti and his assistants.
This repo, at least, really teaches the subjects.
It's a course that does everything in order to discard it (complete disinterest by anyone involved).
Here, concepts, challenges and exams are explained well and properly.
